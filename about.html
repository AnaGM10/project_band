            of Bryce Savage (born Brandon Horth) and Cameron Wales.[2][3][4] 
            They produce remixes and original songs characterized by a mixture 
            of electronic and rap genres.[5][6][7] Bryce writes lyrics and 
            sings whereas Cameron creates the instrumental and does the editing.
            [6] They have released many of their songs royalty-free.[3][8]

        <P>Bryce and Cameron first met in high school when they were 15 years old.
            [3] At that time, they were involved in a punk rock band.[2][11] 
            Thereafter, both exited the band and started making their own music.[3] 
            However, this was not yet the creation of Neffex.[2] After high school,
            Cameron moved to Los Angeles and got distant from Bryce during college.[3] 
            When Bryce was in the last year of college, he talked to Cameron and they 
            noticed both were making music in their free time.[3] After college, they 
            got together again, in Orange County, and created the name "NEFFEX" and the 
            fox symbol.[2][3
